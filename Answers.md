Sprint-Challenge--Data-Structures Questions

1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
        Stack - the order of insertions/removals for a stack is LIFO (Last In First Out).
        Queue - the order of insertions/removals for a stack is FIFO (First In First Out).


2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
        Linked List - O(n) - linear time
        Hash Table - O(1) - Constant time 
        Binary Search Trees - 0(log(n)) - logarithmic time

3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

   Hash Tables have a faster retrieval time than arrays and you do not have to search
   an entire array for a value. Hash tables are also faster at deletion of values than an array.
